        <div class="roadmap-step">
            <h3>Step 1: High School Education</h3>
            <p>To become a teacher, it's essential to excel in subjects like <span class="highlight">Mathematics</span>, <span class="highlight">Science</span>, and <span class="highlight">English</span> during high school. These subjects will form the foundation for your further studies in teacher training.</p>
            <p>During this stage, focus on building strong analytical and communication skills. These are vital for effectively teaching students later in your career.</p>

        <div class="roadmap-step">
            <h3>Step 2: Complete an Undergraduate Degree</h3>
            <p>After high school, pursuing an undergraduate degree in a subject you're passionate about is key. You can opt for a <span class="highlight">Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.)</span> if you want to directly move into teaching, or choose a subject-specific <span class="highlight">Bachelor's degree</span> (e.g., B.A., B.Sc.) depending on your teaching focus.</p>
            <p>If you plan to teach at the primary or secondary school level, a B.Ed. is usually mandatory. This program includes pedagogical training, classroom management, and subject knowledge development.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Clear Teacher Eligibility Test (TET)</h3>
            <p>To be recognized as a qualified teacher in India, clearing a Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) is essential. Depending on the grade level you want to teach, you will need to clear exams like <span class="highlight">CTET</span> (Central Teacher Eligibility Test) or <span class="highlight">STET</span> (State Teacher Eligibility Test).</p>
            <p>These tests assess your knowledge of subjects, teaching skills, and child development. It’s crucial to prepare well using the right study material and mock tests.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Start Teaching</h3>
            <p>Once you pass the TET and obtain your teaching certification, you can start applying for teaching jobs. Most teachers start their careers as <span class="highlight">junior teachers</span> or <span class="highlight">assistant teachers</span> in schools. These positions give you an opportunity to build classroom experience and further refine your teaching techniques.</p>
            <p>Look for jobs in both government and private schools. Some well-known schools that offer job opportunities for new teachers include Navodaya Vidyalayas, Kendriya Vidyalayas, and local private institutions.</p>

This is especially beneficial if you want to teach at the college or university level or specialize in a particular subject.</p>
            <p>An M.Ed. can also help you develop expertise in educational leadership, curriculum development, and educational research.</p>
